* Commentary

This library should provide font highlighting for SPSS program files.
It doesn't seem to work very well, but since I don't use SPSS anymore
I leave it to someone else to fix up. 
The github repo is here if you want to fork it: https://github.com/vapniks/spss

* Installation

 - If you have [[http://www.marmalade-repo.org/][marmalade-repo.org]], this spss is part of the emacs packages you can install.  Just type M-x package-install spss marmalade 
 - Otherwise download the library from here Lisp:spss, and put it in a directory in the emacs load path, like ~/.emacs.d
 - Add (require 'spss) in your ~/.emacs file
